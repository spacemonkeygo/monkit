# ![monkit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/master/images/logo.png)

Package monkit is a flexible code instrumenting and data collection library.

See documentation at https://godoc.org/github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3

Software is hard. Like, really hard.
[Just the worst](http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks). Sometimes it
feels like we've constructed a field where the whole point is to see how
tangled we can get ourselves before seeing if we can get tangled up more while
trying to get untangled.

Many software engineering teams are coming to realize (some slower than others)
that collecting data over time about how their systems are functioning is a
super power you can't turn back from. Some teams are calling this
[Telemetry](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/12/introducing-atlas-netflixs-primary.html),
[Observability](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/observability-at-twitter), or
describing it more basically through subcomponents such as
[distributed tracing](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html),
[time-series data](https://influxdata.com/), or even just
[metrics](http://metrics.dropwizard.io/). We've been calling it monitoring, but
geez, I suppose if trends continue and you want to do this yourself your first
step should be to open a thesaurus and pick an unused term.

I'm not here to tell you about our whole platform. Instead, I'm here to
explain a redesign of a Go library for instrumenting your Go programs that we
rather quietly launched a few years ago. If you are already using version 1 of
our [old library](https://github.com/spacemonkeygo/monitor), we're sorry, but
we rewrote it from scratch and renamed it to monkit. This one (this one!) is
better - you should switch!

I'm going to try and sell you as fast as I can on this library.

## Example usage

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "math/rand"
  "net/http"
  "time"

  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/environment"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/present"
)

var mon = monkit.Package()

func main() {
  environment.Register(monkit.Default)

  go http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:9000", present.HTTP(monkit.Default))

  for {
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    log.Println(DoStuff(context.Background()))
  }
}

func DoStuff(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(&err)

  result, err := ComputeThing(ctx, 1, 2)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  fmt.Println(result)
  return
}

func ComputeThing(ctx context.Context, arg1, arg2 int) (res int, err error) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(&err)

  timer := mon.Timer("subcomputation").Start()
  res = arg1 + arg2
  timer.Stop()

  if res == 3 {
    mon.Event("hit 3")
  }

  mon.BoolVal("was-4").Observe(res == 4)
  mon.IntVal("res").Observe(int64(res))
  mon.DurationVal("took").Observe(time.Second + time.Duration(rand.Intn(int(10*time.Second))))
  mon.Counter("calls").Inc(1)
  mon.Gauge("arg1", func() float64 { return float64(arg1) })
  mon.Meter("arg2").Mark(arg2)

  return arg1 + arg2, nil
}

```

## Metrics

We've got tools that capture distribution information (including quantiles)
about int64, float64, and bool types. We have tools that capture data about
events (we've got meters for deltas, rates, etc). We have rich tools for
capturing information about tasks and functions, and literally anything that
can generate a name and a number.

Almost just as importantly, the amount of boilerplate and code you have to
write to get these features is very minimal. Data that's hard to measure
probably won't get measured.

This data can be collected and sent to [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/)
or any other time-series database.

## Call graphs

This library generates call graphs of your live process for you.

These call graphs aren't created through sampling. They're full pictures of all
of the interesting functions you've annotated, along with quantile information
about their successes, failures, how often they panic, return an error (if so
instrumented), how many are currently running, etc.

The data can be returned in dot format, in json, in text, and can be about
just the functions that are currently executing, or all the functions the
monitoring system has ever seen.

Here's another example of one of our production nodes:

![callgraph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/master/images/callgraph2.png)

## Trace graphs

This library generates trace graphs of your live process for you directly,
without requiring standing up some tracing system such as Zipkin (though you
can do that too).

Inspired by [Google's Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html)
and [Twitter's Zipkin](http://zipkin.io), we have process-internal trace
graphs, triggerable by a number of different methods.

You get this trace information for free whenever you use
[Go contexts](https://blog.golang.org/context) and function monitoring. The
output formats are svg and json.

Additionally, the library supports trace observation plugins, and we've written
[a plugin that sends this data to Zipkin](http://github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit-zipkin).

![trace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/master/images/trace.png)

## History

Before our crazy
[Go rewrite of everything](https://www.spacemonkey.com/blog/posts/go-space-monkey)
(and before we had even seen Google's Dapper paper), we were a Python shop, and
all of our "interesting" functions were decorated with a helper that collected
timing information and sent it to Graphite.

When we transliterated to Go, we wanted to preserve that functionality, so the
first version of our monitoring package was born.

Over time it started to get janky, especially as we found Zipkin and started
adding tracing functionality to it. We rewrote all of our Go code to use Google
contexts, and then realized we could get call graph information. We decided a
refactor and then an all-out rethinking of our monitoring package was best,
and so now we have this library.

## Aside about contexts

Sometimes you really want callstack contextual information without having to
pass arguments through everything on the call stack. In other languages, many
people implement this with thread-local storage.

Example: let's say you have written a big system that responds to user
requests. All of your libraries log using your log library. During initial
development everything is easy to debug, since there's low user load, but now
you've scaled and there's OVER TEN USERS and it's kind of hard to tell what log
lines were caused by what. Wouldn't it be nice to add request ids to all of the
log lines kicked off by that request? Then you could grep for all log lines
caused by a specific request id. Geez, it would suck to have to pass all
contextual debugging information through all of your callsites.

Google solved this problem by always passing a `context.Context` interface
through from call to call. A `Context` is basically just a mapping of arbitrary
keys to arbitrary values that users can add new values for. This way if you
decide to add a request context, you can add it to your `Context` and then all
callsites that descend from that place will have the new data in their contexts.

It is admittedly very verbose to add contexts to every function call.
Painfully so. I hope to write more about it in the future, but [Google also
wrote up their thoughts about it](https://blog.golang.org/context), which you
can go read. For now, just swallow your disgust and let's keep moving.

## Motivating program

Let's make a super simple [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) clone.
Open up gedit! (Okay just kidding, open whatever text editor you want.)

For this motivating program, we won't even add the caching, though there's
comments for where to add it if you'd like. For now, let's just make a
barebones system that will proxy HTTP requests. We'll call it VLite, but
maybe we should call it VReallyLite.

```go
package main

import (
  "flag"
  "net/http"
  "net/http/httputil"
  "net/url"
)

type VLite struct {
  target *url.URL
  proxy  *httputil.ReverseProxy
}

func NewVLite(target *url.URL) *VLite {
  return &VLite{
	  target: target,
	  proxy:  httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(target),
  }
}

func (v *VLite) Proxy(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  r.Host = v.target.Host // let the proxied server get the right vhost
  v.proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}

func (v *VLite) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // here's where you'd put caching logic
  v.Proxy(w, r)
}

func main() {
  target := flag.String(
	  "proxy",
	  "http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/",
	  "server to cache")
  flag.Parse()
  targetURL, err := url.Parse(*target)
  if err != nil {
	  panic(err)
  }
  panic(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", NewVLite(targetURL)))
}
```

Run and build this and open `localhost:8080` in your browser. If you use the
default proxy target, it should inform you that the world hasn't been
destroyed yet.

## Adding basic instrumentation

The first thing you'll want to do is add the small amount of boilerplate to
make the instrumentation we're going to add to your process observable later.

Import the basic monkit packages:

```go
"github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3"
"github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/environment"
"github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/present"
```

and then register environmental statistics and kick off a goroutine in your
main method to serve debug requests:

```go
environment.Register(monkit.Default)
go http.ListenAndServe("localhost:9000", present.HTTP(monkit.Default))
```

Rebuild, and then check out `localhost:9000/stats` (or
`localhost:9000/stats/json`, if you prefer) in your browser!

## Request contexts

Remember what I said about [Google's contexts](https://blog.golang.org/context)?
It might seem a bit overkill for such a small project, but it's time to add
them.

To help out here, I've created a library that constructs contexts for you
for incoming HTTP requests. Nothing that's about to happen requires my
[webhelp library](https://godoc.org/github.com/jtolds/webhelp), but here is the
code now refactored to receive and pass contexts through our two per-request
calls.

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "flag"
  "net/http"
  "net/http/httputil"
  "net/url"

  "github.com/jtolds/webhelp"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/environment"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/present"
)

type VLite struct {
  target *url.URL
  proxy  *httputil.ReverseProxy
}

func NewVLite(target *url.URL) *VLite {
  return &VLite{
	  target: target,
	  proxy:  httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(target),
  }
}

func (v *VLite) Proxy(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  r.Host = v.target.Host // let the proxied server get the right vhost
  v.proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}

func (v *VLite) HandleHTTP(ctx context.Context, w webhelp.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error {
  // here's where you'd put caching logic
  v.Proxy(ctx, w, r)
  return nil
}

func main() {
  target := flag.String(
	  "proxy",
	  "http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/",
	  "server to cache")
  flag.Parse()
  targetURL, err := url.Parse(*target)
  if err != nil {
	  panic(err)
  }
  environment.Register(monkit.Default)
  go http.ListenAndServe("localhost:9000", present.HTTP(monkit.Default))
  panic(webhelp.ListenAndServe(":8080", NewVLite(targetURL)))
}
```

You can create a new context for a request however you want. One reason to use
something like webhelp is that the cancelation feature of Contexts is hooked
up to the HTTP request getting canceled.

## Monitor some requests

Let's start to get statistics about how many requests we receive! First, this
package (main) will need to get a monitoring Scope. Add this global definition
right after all your imports, much like you'd create a logger with many logging
libraries:

```go
var mon = monkit.Package()
```

Now, make the error return value of HandleHTTP named (so, (err error)), and add
this defer line as the very first instruction of HandleHTTP:

```go
func (v *VLite) HandleHTTP(ctx context.Context, w webhelp.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) (err error) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(&err)
```

Let's also add the same line (albeit modified for the lack of error) to
Proxy, replacing &err with nil:

```go
func (v *VLite) Proxy(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(nil)
```

You should now have something like:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "flag"
  "net/http"
  "net/http/httputil"
  "net/url"

  "github.com/jtolds/webhelp"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/environment"
  "github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/v3/present"
)

var mon = monkit.Package()

type VLite struct {
  target *url.URL
  proxy  *httputil.ReverseProxy
}

func NewVLite(target *url.URL) *VLite {
  return &VLite{
	  target: target,
	  proxy:  httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(target),
  }
}

func (v *VLite) Proxy(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(nil)
  r.Host = v.target.Host // let the proxied server get the right vhost
  v.proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}

func (v *VLite) HandleHTTP(ctx context.Context, w webhelp.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) (err error) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(&err)
  // here's where you'd put caching logic
  v.Proxy(ctx, w, r)
  return nil
}

func main() {
  target := flag.String(
	  "proxy",
	  "http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/",
	  "server to cache")
  flag.Parse()
  targetURL, err := url.Parse(*target)
  if err != nil {
	  panic(err)
  }
  environment.Register(monkit.Default)
  go http.ListenAndServe("localhost:9000", present.HTTP(monkit.Default))
  panic(webhelp.ListenAndServe(":8080", NewVLite(targetURL)))
}
```

We'll unpack what's going on here, but for now:

 * Rebuild and restart!
 * Trigger a full refresh at `localhost:8080` to make sure your new HTTP
   handler runs
 * Visit `localhost:9000/stats` and then `localhost:9000/funcs`

For this new funcs dataset, if you want a graph, you can download a dot
graph at `localhost:9000/funcs/dot` and json information from
`localhost:9000/funcs/json`.

You should see something like:

```
[3693964236144930897] main.(*VLite).HandleHTTP
  parents: entry
  current: 0, highwater: 1, success: 2, errors: 0, panics: 0
  success times:
    0.00: 63.930436ms
    0.10: 70.482159ms
    0.25: 80.309745ms
    0.50: 96.689054ms
    0.75: 113.068363ms
    0.90: 122.895948ms
    0.95: 126.17181ms
    1.00: 129.447675ms
    avg: 96.689055ms
  failure times:
    0.00: 0
    0.10: 0
    0.25: 0
    0.50: 0
    0.75: 0
    0.90: 0
    0.95: 0
    1.00: 0
    avg: 0
```

with a similar report for the Proxy method, or a graph like:

![handlehttp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/master/images/handlehttp.png)

This data reports the overall callgraph of execution for known traces, along
with how many of each function are currently running, the most running
concurrently (the highwater), how many were successful along with quantile
timing information, how many errors there were (with quantile timing
information if applicable), and how many panics there were. Since the Proxy
method isn't capturing a returned err value, and since HandleHTTP always
returns nil, this example won't ever have failures.

If you're wondering about the success count being higher than you expected,
keep in mind your browser probably requested a favicon.ico.

Cool, eh?

## How it works

```go
defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(&err)
```

is an interesting line of code - there's three function calls. If you look at
the Go spec, all of the function calls will run at the time the function starts
except for the very last one.

The first function call, mon.Task(), creates or looks up a wrapper around a
Func. You could get this yourself by requesting mon.Func() inside of the
appropriate function or mon.FuncNamed(). Both mon.Task() and mon.Func()
are inspecting runtime.Caller to determine the name of the function. Because
this is a heavy operation, you can actually store the result of mon.Task() and
reuse it somehow else if you prefer, so instead of

```go
func MyFunc(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
  defer mon.Task()(&ctx)(&err)
}
```

you could instead use

```go
var myFuncMon = mon.Task()

func MyFunc(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
  defer myFuncMon(&ctx)(&err)
}
```

which is more performant every time after the first time. runtime.Caller only
gets called once.

Careful! Don't use the same myFuncMon in different functions unless you want to
screw up your statistics!

The second function call starts all the various stop watches and bookkeeping to
keep track of the function. It also mutates the context pointer it's given to
extend the context with information about what current span (in Zipkin
parlance) is active. Notably, you *can* pass nil for the context if you really
don't want a context. You just lose callgraph information.

The last function call stops all the stop watches ad makes a note of any
observed errors or panics (it repanics after observing them).

## Tracing

Turns out, we don't even need to change our program anymore to get rich tracing
information!

Open your browser and go to `localhost:9000/trace/svg?regex=HandleHTTP`. It
won't load, and in fact, it's waiting for you to open another tab and refresh
`localhost:8080` again. Once you retrigger the actual application behavior,
the trace regex will capture a trace starting on the first function that
matches the supplied regex, and return an svg. Go back to your first tab, and
you should see a relatively uninteresting but super promising svg.

Let's make the trace more interesting. Add a

```go
time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
```

to your HandleHTTP method, rebuild, and restart. Load `localhost:8080`, then
start a new request to your trace URL, then reload `localhost:8080` again. Flip
back to your trace, and you should see that the Proxy method only takes a
portion of the time of HandleHTTP!

![trace](https://cdn.rawgit.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit/master/images/trace.svg)

There's multiple ways to select a trace. You can select by regex using the
preselect method (default), which first evaluates the regex on all known
functions for sanity checking. Sometimes, however, the function you want to
trace may not yet be known to monkit, in which case you'll want
to turn preselection off. You may have a bad regex, or you may be in this case
if you get the error "Bad Request: regex preselect matches 0 functions."

Another way to select a trace is by providing a trace id, which we'll get to
next!

Make sure to check out what the addition of the time.Sleep call did to the
other reports.

## Plugins

It's easy to write plugins for monkit! Check out our first one that exports
data to [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/)'s Scribe API:

 * https://github.com/spacemonkeygo/monkit-zipkin

We plan to have more (for HTrace, OpenTracing, etc, etc), soon!
